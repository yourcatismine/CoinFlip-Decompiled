# ==========================================
# Vault Currency Configuration
# ==========================================
# Vault (Money) - Requires Vault plugin and an economy plugin (e.g., EssentialsX, CMI)
# This currency uses the server's economy system through Vault API

# Enable/disable this currency
enabled: true

# Display Settings
# Currency unit - Used in messages, GUI, Discord webhooks, and game displays to show the currency unit
# This is displayed after amounts (e.g., "100$", "50 Points", "25 Tokens")
# Examples: "$", "Points", "Tokens", "Coins", "Dollars", "Credits"
unit: '$'
display-name: 'Money'

# ==========================================
# Command Syntax Configuration
# ==========================================
# Command syntax used in /coinflip create command
# This is the keyword that players will use to specify this currency
# Example: If syntax-command is "money", players will use: /coinflip create money <amount>
# This will be the only command shown in command completion (tab completion)
# Must be unique across all currencies
# Recommended: Use simple, lowercase words without spaces or special characters
syntax-command: 'money'

# ==========================================
# Broadcast Settings
# ==========================================
# Enable/disable broadcasting game results for this currency
# When enabled, players will see a message when a game with this currency is created or completed
broadcast-enabled: true
# Minimum bet amount required for a game to be broadcasted
# Games with bet amounts below this value will not be broadcasted
# Set to 0 to broadcast all games, or a high value to only broadcast large games
# Example: 100 means only games with 100 or more will be broadcasted
min-broadcast-amount: 100

# ==========================================
# Betting Limits
# ==========================================
# Minimum bet amount that players can place for this currency
# Must be greater than or equal to 0
# Recommended: 1 or higher to prevent zero-bet games
min-bid: 1
# Maximum bet amount that players can place for this currency
# Set to -1 to disable maximum limit (unlimited)
# Set to a positive number to limit maximum bet amount
# Must be greater than or equal to min-bid if set
# Example: 10000 means players can bet up to 10000
max-bid: -1

# Minimum reserve balance that must remain after betting
# Prevents players from betting their entire balance, which could bypass limits in other plugins
# Example: If min-reserve-balance is 1000, and player has 300K, they can bet at most 299K
# Set to 0 to allow players to bet their entire balance (default behavior)
# Recommended: Set to a value that matches your other plugin's minimum balance requirements
# Example: If your fly plugin requires 300K minimum balance, set this to 300000
min-reserve-balance: 0

# ==========================================
# Tax System
# ==========================================
# Enable/disable tax system for this currency
# When disabled (false), no tax will be applied regardless of tax-rate settings
# When enabled (true), tax will be calculated based on tax-rate or dynamic-tax settings below
# Set to false to completely disable tax for this currency
tax-enabled: true

# Tax rate applied to the total pot (both players' bets combined) for this currency
# Tax is deducted from the total pot before giving winnings to the winner
# Only used when tax-enabled is true
# 
# How it works:
# - Player 1 bets: 100
# - Player 2 bets: 100
# - Total pot: 200
# - Tax rate: 0.1 (10%)
# - Tax amount: 200 * 0.1 = 20
# - Winner receives: 200 * (1 - 0.1) = 180 (after tax)
# - Loser receives: 0
# 
# Formula:
#   Total Pot = Bet Amount × 2
#   Tax = Total Pot × Tax Rate
#   Winner Receives = Total Pot × (1 - Tax Rate)
# 
# Value range: 0.0 to 1.0 (0% to 100%)
# - 0.0 = No tax (winner receives full pot)
# - 0.1 = 10% tax (winner receives 90% of pot)
# - 0.5 = 50% tax (winner receives 50% of pot)
# - 1.0 = 100% tax (winner receives nothing - NOT recommended!)
# 
# Recommended values:
# - 0.0 to 0.1 (0% to 10%) for player-friendly servers
# - 0.1 to 0.2 (10% to 20%) for balanced economy
# - 0.2 to 0.3 (20% to 30%) for economy control
# 
# Note: Tax is rounded to 2 decimal places to avoid floating point errors
# The winner always receives the remaining amount after tax deduction
tax-rate: 0.1

# ==========================================
# Dynamic Tax Rate System
# ==========================================
# Enable/disable dynamic tax rate system
# When enabled, tax rate will be calculated based on bet amount tiers (see tax-rate-config below)
# When disabled, the simple tax-rate above will be used
dynamic-tax-enabled: false

# Dynamic tax rate configuration
# Only used when dynamic-tax-enabled is true
# If dynamic-tax-enabled is false, this section is ignored and tax-rate above is used instead
tax-rate-config:
  # Default tax rate (fallback if no tier matches)
  base-tax-rate: 0.1
  # Tax rate by bet amount (last matching tier wins - later tiers override earlier ones)
  # Note: If tiers overlap, the tier configured later will override the earlier one
  # Example: Tier 1 (0-1000: 5%) and Tier 2 (500-1200: 15%)
  #   - Bet 501: Both match → Tier 2 wins (15%)
  #   - Bet 400: Only Tier 1 matches → Tier 1 wins (5%)
  tiers:
    # Minimum amount (inclusive)
    - min-amount: 0
      # Maximum amount (exclusive, -1 = unlimited)
      max-amount: 100
      # Note: max-amount is EXCLUSIVE - tier 0-100 matches 0 to 99.999... but NOT 100
      # To include 100, set max-amount to 101 or higher
      # Tax rate for this tier (5%)
      tax-rate: 0.05
    - min-amount: 100
      max-amount: 1000
      # 10% tax
      tax-rate: 0.1
    - min-amount: 1000
      # -1 = unlimited
      max-amount: -1
      # 15% tax
      tax-rate: 0.15

# ==========================================
# Currency Restrictions
# ==========================================
# Restrict currency usage based on world and permissions
# Examples:
#   - Only survival worlds: allowed-worlds: [world, world_nether]
#   - Block specific worlds: blocked-worlds: [lobby, creative]
#   - Require permission: required-permissions: [ultracoinflip.vip]
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - You can use the same permission for multiple currencies (each currency has its own restrictions)
# - If a world is in both allowed-worlds and blocked-worlds, blocked takes priority (world will be blocked)
#   Plugin will show a warning in console if this happens
restrictions:
  # Enable/disable restrictions (false = no restrictions)
  enabled: false
  # Allowed worlds (empty = all worlds allowed)
  # If a world is in both allowed-worlds and blocked-worlds, blocked takes priority
  allowed-worlds: []
  # Blocked worlds (takes priority over allowed-worlds)
  # If a world appears in both lists, it will be blocked (warning will be shown in console)
  blocked-worlds: []
  # Required permissions (empty = no permissions required, player needs at least one)
  # You can use the same permission for multiple currencies - each currency is independent
  required-permissions: []

# Configuration Version
# ==========================================
# DO NOT MODIFY THIS VALUE - It is used by the plugin to track configuration updates
# Changing this value may cause configuration issues
