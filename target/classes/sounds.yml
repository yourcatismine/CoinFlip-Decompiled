# ==========================================
# Sound Configuration
# ==========================================
# All sounds used by the UltraCoinFlip plugin
# Get sound names from: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Sound.html
#
# Format:
#   sound-name:
#     enabled: true/false
#     sound: 'SOUND_NAME'  # Minecraft sound enum name or namespace:key format
#     volume: 1.0          # Volume (0.0 to 1.0)
#     pitch: 1.0           # Pitch (0.5 to 2.0)
#
# IMPORTANT FOR MINECRAFT 1.8.8 SERVERS:
# If you are running Minecraft 1.8.8, you MUST use the legacy sound names instead of modern ones.
# The plugin will automatically handle sound compatibility, but you can manually configure 1.8 sound IDs:
#   - ENTITY_PLAYER_LEVELUP → LEVEL_UP
#   - ENTITY_VILLAGER_NO → VILLAGER_NO
#   - ENTITY_EXPERIENCE_ORB_PICKUP → ORB_PICKUP
#   - UI_BUTTON_CLICK → WOOD_CLICK
#   - BLOCK_NOTE_BLOCK_PLING → NOTE_PLING
#   - BLOCK_CHEST_OPEN → CHEST_OPEN
#   - BLOCK_ANVIL_USE → ANVIL_USE
#   - BLOCK_WOODEN_BUTTON_CLICK_ON → WOOD_CLICK
#   - BLOCK_NOTE_BLOCK_BASS → NOTE_BASS
# For example, if you want to use 1.8 sound names, change 'ENTITY_PLAYER_LEVELUP' to 'LEVEL_UP'
# The plugin supports both modern (1.9+) and legacy (1.8.8) sound names automatically.
