# Custom Placeholder Currency Configuration
# ==========================================
# Placeholder-based currencies - Requires PlaceholderAPI
# IMPORTANT: The placeholder MUST output a numeric value (a number)
# For detailed comments and examples, see vault.yml
# ==========================================
# PLACEHOLDER API USAGE:
# When using PlaceholderAPI placeholders, use your currency ID as the <currency> value.
# 
# Example: If your currency ID is "orbs", you can use:
#   %coinflip_placeholder_orbs_unit% - Unit of the currency (e.g., "Orbs")
#   %coinflip_placeholder_orbs_display% - Display name of the currency (e.g., "Orbs")
#   %coinflip_orbs_unit% - Short format (same as above)
#   %coinflip_orbs_display% - Short format (same as above)
#
# In GUI config files, you can use:
#   <placeholder_orbs_unit> - Unit of the currency
#   <placeholder_orbs_display> - Display name of the currency
#
# NOTE: Custom placeholder currencies are NOT tracked in statistics.
#       Therefore, winrate/profit/loss placeholders for custom currencies will return "0".
#       Only built-in currencies (money, playerpoints, tokenmanager, beasttokens) have statistics tracking.
#       For winrate placeholders, use: %coinflip_winrate_<currency>% where <currency> is one of:
#         - money (Vault currency)
#         - playerpoints (PlayerPoints currency)
#         - tokenmanager (TokenManager currency)
#         - beasttokens (BeastTokens currency)
# ==========================================
# MULTIPLE CURRENCIES SUPPORTED:
# You can add as many custom currencies as you want!
# Just copy the currency structure below and give it a unique ID.
# Example:
#   currencies:
#     orbs:         <- Currency ID
#       enabled: true
#       tax-rate: 0.1
#       dynamic-tax-enabled: false  <- Each currency has its own tax config
#       ...
#     gems:         <- Another currency ID
#       enabled: true
#       tax-rate: 0.15
#       dynamic-tax-enabled: true   <- Can be different from orbs!
#       tax-rate-config:
#         base-tax-rate: 0.2
#         tiers: ...
#       ...
#     tokens:       <- Yet another currency ID
#       enabled: true
#       ...
# ==========================================
# DYNAMIC TAX PER CURRENCY:
# Each currency can have its own dynamic tax configuration!
# This allows you to set different tax rates for different currencies.
# For example: Orbs might have 5-10-15% tax tiers, while Gems have 10-20-30%.
# ==========================================

currencies:
  # Example Currency 1: Orbs
  # The key (orbs) is the currency ID - you can change this to any unique name
  # IMPORTANT: This currency ID is used in PlaceholderAPI placeholders!
  # Example placeholders for this currency (currency ID = "orbs"):
  #   %coinflip_placeholder_orbs_unit% or %coinflip_orbs_unit% - Returns: "Orbs"
  #   %coinflip_placeholder_orbs_display% or %coinflip_orbs_display% - Returns: "Orbs"
